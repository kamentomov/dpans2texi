                                 dpans2texi.el

   dpans2texi.el converts the TeX sources of the draft ANSI Common Lisp
   standard (dpANS) to the [2]Texinfo format.

   The purpose is to take advantage of the superior qualities of the Info
   reader in Emacs compared with other formats, viz.
     * Single-key index lookup with completion: i.
     * Single-key full text regexp search: s
     * Convenient symbol lookup from source code: C-h C-i

   There are [3]various existing ways to do the latter, though, by
   opening a web browser at the right spot in the [4]Common Lisp
   HyperSpec. But this means leaving Emacs ... a Bad Thing(TM).

   Some of the information conveyed by the selection of fonts in the
   hard-copy version is lost in the translation to Texinfo. I've also
   made frivolous use of Unicode characters to represent various glyphs
   -- you might need to [5]supplement your fontset to avoid empty boxes
   in Emacs.

   As a side effect of using Texinfo you can also produce a HTML version.
   This wasn't really a target, but I think the result is quite decent
   nevertheless.

   I won't distribute the converted files, as the draft doesn't grant me
   permission to do so. So, you need to run the converter on the original
   TeX files yourself.

   Caveat: The translation may have introduced errors, please report
   discrepancies with the hard-copy version.

   Q: Why didn't you just use Bill Schelter's [8]Texinfo rendition?
   A: Good question! I didn't learn about it until I had finished most of
   my converter, so I might as well do the rest. I think my version is a
   bit more polished (I also had the advantage of some handy new Texinfo
   commands introduced since 1994). Besides, having a converter means
   that it's fairly easy to customize aspects of the conversion to your
   preference.

  Installation

     * You need Texinfo 4.7 (released 10-04-2004) or later.
     * Get dpans2texi-1.03.tar.gz and unpack the tarball.
     * Run ./configure
     * Run make wget to download the .tex files with wget (or download
       them directly from [10]parcftp.xerox.com/pub/cl/dpANS3 and
       [11]parcftp.xerox.com/pub/cl/dpANS3R to the same directory).
     * Build the info files with make, and finally install them in your
       Info directory with make install
     * To use C-h C-i in Lisp mode to look up the symbol at point in the
       spec, add the following to your .emacs file:
   (require 'info-look)
   (info-lookup-add-help
    :mode 'lisp-mode
    :regexp "[^][()'\" \t\n]+"
    :ignore-case t
    :doc-spec '(("(ansicl)Symbol Index" nil nil nil)))
     * Run make html if you want a HTML version. You can also produce
       Docbook and XML versions with the xml and docbook targets.

  Problems

   Bugs in Texinfo and Emacs rather than the converter as such:
     * Backreferences from the list of figures are broken in Info.
     * makeinfo crashes on the XML, Docbook and HTML targets on Mac OS X.
     * Emacs on Mac OS X doesn't display all characters even though the
       font does contain them.
